1. enjoying personal computing rights or liberty, as a person who is not controlled by corporate or state entities: "a land of people free to customize their computing  devices."
2. pertaining to or reserved for those who enjoy personal computing liberty: "They were thankful to be securely computing on a usable device."

State Actors and Corporate Entities Try to Control You
* From State owned backdoors to corporate device obsoletion, the hurdle to you truly owning your computing device is nearly insurmountable, until now.

We Need A Securable, Modifiable, Usable Computing Device
* Many people around the globe, not just the affluent, need durable security. But State actors pressure their indigenous corporations to create backdoors. And, corporations design their products for obsoletion so they can create more expensive, consumable devices.

Freemod.blue Is Working To Change This
* Personal computing power has changed little in the past decade. We can modify the proprietary firmware, disable the tiny embedded "management" computer, and then install a secure operating system. We only need to put these pieces together to make secure, personal computing available to everyone.
