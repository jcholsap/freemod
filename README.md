freemod / 'fri-mɒd /
adjective, freemodd·er, freemodd·est.
1. enjoying personal computing rights or liberty, as a person who is not controlled by corporate or state entities:a land of people free to customize their computing  devices.
2. pertaining to or reserved for those who enjoy personal computing liberty:They were thankful to be securely computing on a usable device.

State Actors and Corporate Entities Try to Control You
From State owned backdoors to corporate device obsoletion, the hurdle to you truly owning your computing device is nearly insurmountable, until now.

Who needs secure, modifiable, usable computing?
Many people around the globe, not just the wealthy, need a secure, modifiable, usable computing device. But State actors pressure their indigenous corporations to create backdoors. And, corporations design their products for obsoletion to create consumable, rather than durable, personal computers.

Freemod.blue aims to change all that!

Personal computing power really hasn't changed in five years. It's obvious that advancements are focused on power consumption. That's nice. But riddle me this:
        1. What about the tonnes of e-waste?
        2. How about letting us modify our own devices?
        3. Are you secure with an embedded computer "managing" your personal computing device?
